                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>I started drawing when I was 3 years old. Later, at the age of 12, I enrolled at the art academy of visual art at Borsbeek.
                    The first few years were general art courses, the last couple of years we had to make a choice between a couple of artforms, at which point I chose for digital art, which included courses about photo manipulation and photography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, I started practising my painting. I first started with basic techniques, using acrylic paint, but I later on transitioned to using oil-based paint as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In high school I studied publicity and Illustration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent the past few years improving my skills, starting with concept art, digital painting and video editing.
